This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Responsive Website Design:
What is Responsive Design? A responsive design ensures that your website adapts to each unique device, automatically resizing all content, images, and functionalities for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Why Use Responsive Website Design? Whether customers are accessing your site on-the-go or from their desktop, the user experience is always optimized. A responsive website dynamically adjusts its layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop, ensuring ease of use on any device.

Mobile Usage:
Rapidly Growing Mobile Usage: With mobile web usage growing rapidly, a website that is not responsive for mobile devices could miss out on significant business opportunities. Our professional responsive designs deliver outstanding results for all users, regardless of device.

Time and Cost:
Efficient in Terms of Time and Cost: Responsive website design creates efficiency in development time and cost. This approach allows you to optimize your online business for all devices with a single design, eliminating the need for building a separate mobile site.

Ranking High:
Best Practices for Ranking High in Mobile Search Results: Responsive design is the preferred option for making your website both mobile-friendly and search engine-friendly. A responsive website greatly benefits your SEO initiatives and aligns with Google’s ‘mobile-first index’ approach, providing an optimized experience for all screen sizes and improving search engine visibility.
